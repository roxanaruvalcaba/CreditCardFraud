# CreditCardFraud

This project was part of a team project for a Machine Learning with Spark class I took through UC Berkeley Extension. The problem we wanted to analyze was, can we create a model that can consistently detect credit card fraud. We concluded that the KNN and Random Forest models gave good recall and precision compared to the other models we attempted. For more details, please refer to the PPT.
