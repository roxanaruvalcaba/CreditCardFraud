# CreditCardFraud

This project was part of a team project for a Machine Learning with Spark class I took through UC Berkeley Extension. The problem we wanted to analyze was, can we create a model that can consistently detect credit card fraud. We concluded that the KNN and Random Forest models gave good recall and precision compared to the other models we attempted.
